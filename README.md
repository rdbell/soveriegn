# soveriegn

Sovereign is a command-line tool that interfaces with 1Password agilekeychain files.

Sovereign is intended to be used on operating systems like Linux that don't have an official 1Password client.

Sovereign is currently a work in progress and only supports searching & reading from keychain items. Adding/editing keychain items is not yet supported.

Sovereign is not affiliated with or endorsed by AgileBits in any way.
